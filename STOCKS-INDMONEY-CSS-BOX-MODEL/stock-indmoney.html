                    <p>The AMC charges the fund management fees + distribution (commission) fee to manage a mutual fund. INDmoney works with Direct Plans of mutual funds only.

                    <p>STT is a tax paid on purchase or sale of securities. When it comes to mutual funds, only equity oriented funds attract an STT payment. If you've invested in a debt oriented fund, then no STT applicable on it. STT of 0.025% of sold amount is payable when you sell units of equity mutual funds. STT is not applicable at the time of purchase of equity mutual funds.</p>

                    <p>Exit Loads</p>
                    <p>Exit load is a fee charged by the mutual fund houses if investors sell units within a certain period from the date of investment. Some funds don't charge exit load. Typically, equity mutual fund schemes levy an exit load of 1% if the units are sold within one year of buying. Debt funds, also levy an exit load, but the period could be as low as a day or a month since the overall tenure of the fund could be only a few weeks or months. Liquid funds do not charge any exit load.</p>
